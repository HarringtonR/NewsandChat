# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description | In Progress
|Day 2| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | In Progress
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Day 4| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Day 5| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Day 6| MVP | Incomplete
|Day 7| Present | Incomplete


## Project Description

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Getting data from both News and Chat API's
- Render data on page and design layout
- Create login for chat
- Scrolling chat and news feed
- Link news story to chat room

#### PostMVP 

- Set news to stream
- Filter stories
- Filter by distance
- update news automatically

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App     | This will render the combined logic and branch off the main components. 
| Chat    | Chat will contain all logic for chat room |
| Message List | List of messages sent in chat |
| Message | Contains user Id and Message sent in chat |
| News    | Contains the google news api brains |
| News Form | Filter news if necessary |
| Header | This(if necessary) will contain the Nav |
| Footer | This(if necessary) will contain the Nav | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| App/Logic | H | 7hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Chat API | H | 5hrs| N/A | N/A |
| News API | H | 5hrs| N/A | N/A |
| MessageList| H | 2hrs| N/A | N/A |
| News Feed| H | 2hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Chat Form | H | 5hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Total | H | 31hrs| N/A | N/A |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| onSubmit | Adding Chat to the screen and filter news | 
| onHover | Enlarge the portion of the screen your on | 
| onChange | For forms and filter forms | 

## Additional Libraries
N/A

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

 componentDidMount(){
      const chatManager = new Chatkit.ChatManager({
        instanceLocator: this.props.instanceLocator,
        userId: this.props.username,
        tokenProvider: new Chatkit.TokenProvider({
          url: this.props.testToken
        })
      })
